Human: How do I implement a binary search algorithm in Python?

AI: Here's a clean implementation of binary search in Python:

```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1

    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1

    return -1  # Not found
```

The algorithm works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half, achieving O(log n) time complexity.

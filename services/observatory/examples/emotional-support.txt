Human: I'm feeling really anxious about my upcoming presentation. I always freeze up when speaking in public.

AI: It's completely natural to feel anxious about public speaking - it's one of the most common fears. What you're experiencing is your body's stress response, which can actually be reframed as energy and excitement. Here are some strategies that might help:

1. Practice your presentation multiple times beforehand
2. Focus on breathing exercises before you begin
3. Remember that your audience wants you to succeed
4. Start with a confident posture - it can actually reduce anxiety
5. Have a glass of water nearby for those dry-mouth moments

The key is not to eliminate nervousness entirely, but to channel it productively. What aspect of the presentation worries you most?

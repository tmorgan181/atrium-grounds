# Feature Proposal: Spec-Kit Enhancements

**Status**: üí≠ Ideation (TODO)  
**Feature ID**: 003  
**Created**: 2025-01-04  
**Priority**: Medium

---

## Overview

Enhance the spec-kit tooling (`.github/prompts/`) and development experience to incorporate custom collaboration protocols and improve developer ergonomics based on learnings from Feature 002.

**This is a proposal only. No planning or implementation should occur at this time.**

---

## Problem Statement

Current gaps identified:

1. **Spec-kit prompts don't reference collaboration protocols** - The `/specify`, `/plan`, `/tasks` prompts don't guide agents to set up collaboration structures or explain multi-agent workflows

2. **Developer experience improvements needed** - Feature 002 revealed several UX patterns that could be standardized:
   - Parameter validation patterns
   - Help text organization
   - Clean/minimal output modes
   - Consistent error handling
   - Progress indicators

3. **Collaboration setup is manual** - Each feature requires manually creating collaboration directory structure and documentation

4. **Missing coordination guidance** - Agents need better prompts for when/how to create handoffs, session logs, and coordination documents

---

## Proposed Scope (High-Level Ideas)

### 1. Update Spec-Kit Prompts

**Goal**: Integrate collaboration protocols into specification workflow

Potential updates to `.github/prompts/`:
- **specify.prompt.md**: Add section for multi-agent considerations
- **plan.prompt.md**: Include collaboration directory setup in planning
- **tasks.prompt.md**: Reference delegation and handoff patterns
- **implement.prompt.md**: Guide session logging and coordination
- New prompt: **collaborate.prompt.md** for coordination workflows

### 2. Collaboration Directory Scaffolding

**Goal**: Automate collaboration structure creation

Could include:
- Script or prompt to generate collaboration subdirectories
- Template files for handoffs, proposals, decisions
- Automatic README generation
- Integration with `/specify` workflow

### 3. Developer Experience Standardization

**Goal**: Extract and generalize Feature 002 patterns

Patterns to consider standardizing:
- **Parameter validation framework** (reusable validation patterns)
- **Output modes** (minimal, detail, clean/ANSI-free)
- **Help text templates** (consistent formatting)
- **Progress indicators** (spinners, status lines)
- **Error message formatting** (actionable, scannable)
- **Prerequisites checking** (common validation patterns)

Could manifest as:
- PowerShell module with common functions
- Python utilities library
- Style guide for CLI tools
- Template scripts
- Best practices documentation

### 4. Multi-Agent Coordination Enhancements

**Goal**: Better support for parallel agent workflows

Possible improvements:
- Handoff templates with checklists
- Status dashboard (markdown-based)
- Task assignment tracking
- Conflict detection (who's working on what)
- Session log standardization
- Validation report templates

---

## Success Criteria (If Implemented)

This feature would be successful if:

- [ ] New features automatically get collaboration structure
- [ ] Agents follow consistent coordination patterns
- [ ] Developer experience patterns are reusable across services
- [ ] Spec-kit prompts guide multi-agent workflows
- [ ] Less manual setup required for new features
- [ ] Coordination overhead is reduced

---

## Open Questions

- Should collaboration setup be part of `/specify` or a separate `/collaborate` command?
- How much to standardize vs. letting patterns emerge organically?
- PowerShell-specific vs. language-agnostic tooling?
- Should this be one feature or split into multiple?
- Priority relative to other work (Observatory features, new services)?

## Related Work

- **Feature 002**: Developer Experience Upgrades (in progress) - Source of DX patterns
- **Spec-kit prompts**: `.github/prompts/*.prompt.md` - Current specification workflow
- **Constitution**: `.specify/memory/constitution.md` - Multi-agent collaboration principles
- **Orientation protocol**: `.github/prompts/orient.prompt.md` - Agent coordination basics

---

## Non-Goals (Explicit Exclusions)

This feature should **NOT**:
- Replace existing spec-kit workflows (enhance, don't replace)
- Add complex tooling dependencies (keep it simple)
- Enforce rigid processes (enable, don't constrain)
- Create coordination overhead (reduce friction, don't add it)
- Implement without user validation (this is exploratory)

---

## Next Steps (When Ready)

When/if this moves forward:

1. **Validate need** - Confirm pain points with user
2. **Scope refinement** - Break into smaller features if needed
3. **Run /specify** - Create formal spec with examples
4. **Run /plan** - Architecture and implementation approach
5. **Run /tasks** - Detailed task breakdown
6. **Implement incrementally** - Start with highest-value items

---

## Notes

- This emerged from Feature 002 retrospective
- Keep it lightweight - don't over-engineer
- Focus on reducing friction for multi-agent work
- User preferences matter (ask before implementing)
- Some items may belong in different features

## Addendum: GitHub Branch Protection & PR Workflow

**Added**: 2025-01-05

### Current Repository State

The main branch has a ruleset (`main-branch-protection`) with:
- ‚úÖ PR required for all changes
- ‚úÖ No force pushes
- ‚úÖ No branch deletion
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Bypass enabled for repository admins** (including AI agents)

### Observed Behavior

When pushing to main, GitHub shows:
```
remote: Bypassed rule violations for refs/heads/main:
remote: - Changes must be made through a pull request.
```

**Why**: AI agents with admin access can bypass the PR requirement automatically.

### Self-Enforcement Required

Since admins can bypass the ruleset, **we must self-enforce PR discipline** according to `.specify/memory/pr-workflow-guide.md`:

**Create PRs for:**
- ‚úÖ Feature completion (all acceptance criteria met)
- ‚úÖ Breaking changes (API, schema, config changes)
- ‚úÖ Multi-agent handoffs
- ‚úÖ Constitution compliance questions

**Direct push allowed for:**
- ‚úÖ Documentation-only changes (non-architectural)
- ‚úÖ Test additions (no code changes)
- ‚úÖ Minor dependency updates
- ‚úÖ Infrastructure fixes (CI, tooling)
- ‚úÖ Work-in-progress on feature branches

### Integration with Feature 003

If Feature 003 is implemented, consider:
- Adding PR workflow reminders to spec-kit prompts
- Creating decision tree helper for "Should I create a PR?"
- Automating PR creation at feature completion checkpoints
- Adding PR checklist generation to collaboration scaffolding

**Reference**: `.specify/memory/pr-workflow-guide.md` for complete decision tree and examples.

**Status**: üí≠ **Ideation Phase - Do Not Implement**

This is a feature proposal capturing ideas and possibilities. No specification, planning, or implementation work should occur without explicit user direction.

**Captured**: 2025-01-04 by Copilot CLI after Feature 002 collaboration experience
**Updated**: 2025-01-05 with PR workflow clarification

# Feature 002 Planning Documents

Historical planning documents created during Feature 002 development. These documents were superseded by the actual implementation.

## Planning Documents

### LINTING.md
**Status**: ✅ Implemented (T013-T015)
**Date**: Planning phase
**Purpose**: Design document for code quality tooling integration

**What Was Planned**:
- Integration of ruff (linting + formatting)
- MyPy type checking
- Quick-start.ps1 commands: `lint`, `format`, `check`

**What Was Implemented**:
- ✅ `.\quick-start.ps1 lint` - Code linting with ruff
- ✅ `.\quick-start.ps1 format` - Auto-formatting with ruff
- ✅ `.\quick-start.ps1 check` - Combined lint + type check

**See Implementation**:
- `services/observatory/quick-start.ps1` (lines 1134-1315)
- `services/observatory/docs/MIGRATION-002.md`

### TEST-FILTERING.md
**Status**: ✅ Implemented (T008-T011)
**Date**: Planning phase
**Purpose**: Design document for test filtering feature

**What Was Planned**:
- Granular test control (`-Unit`, `-Contract`, `-Integration`)
- Coverage reporting integration
- Fast feedback loop for developers

**What Was Implemented**:
- ✅ `.\quick-start.ps1 test -Unit` - Unit tests only (~2s, 60x faster)
- ✅ `.\quick-start.ps1 test -Contract` - Contract tests only
- ✅ `.\quick-start.ps1 test -Integration` - Integration tests only
- ✅ `.\quick-start.ps1 test -Validation` - Validation suite only
- ✅ `.\quick-start.ps1 test -Coverage` - Coverage reports

**See Implementation**:
- `services/observatory/quick-start.ps1` (Invoke-Tests function, lines 565-647)
- `services/observatory/docs/WORKFLOW.md` (Test Filtering section)

---

### NEXT-STEPS.md
**Status**: ✅ Completed
**Date**: 2025-01-04 (after Feature 001)
**Purpose**: Development roadmap identifying Feature 002 priorities

**What Was Planned** (Priority 1):
1. Test Filtering Implementation - ✅ Completed (T008-T011)
2. Verbosity Control - ✅ Completed (T003-T007)
3. Code Quality Integration - ✅ Completed (T013-T015)
4. Clean Logging - ✅ Completed (T012)

**All Priority 1 Items**: ✅ Completed in Feature 002

**See Results**:
- `services/observatory/docs/VALIDATION-CHECKLIST-002.md`
- `services/observatory/docs/MIGRATION-002.md`

## Why These Are Archived

These planning documents served their purpose during Feature 002 development:
1. They guided implementation (T001-T028)
2. They were validated against actual implementation
3. All planned features are now live in the codebase
4. Current documentation supersedes these design docs

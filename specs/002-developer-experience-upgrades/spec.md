**Created**: 2025-10-04
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "developer experience upgrades"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí "developer experience upgrades" - enhancing developer workflow tooling
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: developers (human and AI agents)
   ‚Üí Actions: run tests, format code, view logs, control verbosity
   ‚Üí Data: test results, log output, code formatting
   ‚Üí Constraints: must maintain backward compatibility, Windows PowerShell support

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a developer working on the Observatory service, I want a streamlined command-line experience that gives me clean, focused output by default while allowing detailed diagnostics when troubleshooting, so I can work efficiently without information overload.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Clean Default Output
1. **Given** I am setting up the Observatory service for the first time
2. **When** I run `.\quick-start.ps1 setup`
3. **Then** I see only high-level progress and success/failure indicators
4. **And** external tool output (pip, uv) is suppressed
5. **And** setup completes showing clear next steps

#### Scenario 2: Detailed Troubleshooting
1. **Given** setup is failing with an unclear error
2. **When** I run `.\quick-start.ps1 setup -Detail`
3. **Then** I see all step-by-step progress messages
4. **And** full output from all external tools (pip, uv, pytest)
5. **And** detailed error traces for debugging

#### Scenario 3: Clean Windows Logging
1. **Given** I am running the server on Windows PowerShell
2. **When** I run `.\quick-start.ps1 serve -Clean`
3. **Then** server logs display without ANSI escape codes
4. **And** log output is readable in Windows terminal
5. **And** timestamps and log levels are clearly formatted

#### Scenario 4: Focused Test Execution
1. **Given** I want to run only unit tests to verify a fix
2. **When** I run `.\quick-start.ps1 test -Unit`
3. **Then** only unit tests execute (not contract or integration)
4. **And** results display with appropriate verbosity
5. **And** I can add `-Detail` for verbose test output

#### Scenario 5: Code Quality Checks
1. **Given** I have made changes to Python files
2. **When** I run `.\quick-start.ps1 lint`
3. **Then** the linter checks all code without modifying files
4. **And** violations are clearly reported
5. **And** I can run `.\quick-start.ps1 format` to auto-fix issues

### Edge Cases
- What happens when user provides conflicting flags (e.g., `-Detail` and `-Quiet`)?
  ‚Üí System should warn about conflicts and use most verbose flag
- How does system handle missing dependencies for linting tools?
  ‚Üí Clear error message directing user to run `setup` action
- What if clean logging files don't exist?
  ‚Üí Gracefully fall back to standard uvicorn with warning message
- How do test filters interact with coverage flags?
  ‚Üí `-Unit -Coverage` runs unit tests with coverage report
- What happens on non-Windows platforms with `-Clean` flag?
  ‚Üí Flag works on all platforms (ANSI codes are always optional)

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### Verbosity Control
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a default "minimal" output mode showing only action results and critical errors
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide a `-Detail` flag that shows step-by-step progress and full external tool output
- **FR-003**: System MUST suppress external command output (uv, pip, pytest verbose) when not in Detail mode
- **FR-004**: System MUST preserve all error output regardless of verbosity level
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain consistent indicator style ([OK], [FAIL], [WARN], [INFO]) across all verbosity levels

#### Clean Logging Integration
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide a `-Clean` flag for server start that disables ANSI escape codes
- **FR-007**: System MUST use clean logging formatter when `-Clean` flag is provided
- **FR-008**: System MUST fall back gracefully to standard logging if clean logging files are unavailable
- **FR-009**: System MUST format timestamps consistently (e.g., `[2025-01-04 20:30:15]`) in clean logging mode
- **FR-010**: Clean logging MUST work on all platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux)

#### Test Filtering
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide a `-Unit` flag that runs only unit tests
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide a `-Contract` flag that runs only contract tests
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide an `-Integration` flag that runs only integration tests
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide a `-Coverage` flag that generates coverage reports
- **FR-015**: System MUST allow combining test type flags with coverage (e.g., `-Unit -Coverage`)
- **FR-016**: System MUST use quiet pytest mode (`-q`) by default and verbose (`-v`) with `-Detail` flag

#### Code Quality Tools
- **FR-017**: System MUST provide a `lint` action that checks code without modifying files
- **FR-018**: System MUST provide a `format` action that auto-formats code using project standards
- **FR-019**: System MUST provide a `check` action that runs both linting and type checking
- **FR-020**: Linting actions MUST report violations with file paths and line numbers
- **FR-021**: Formatting action MUST preserve existing code functionality (no semantic changes)

#### Backward Compatibility
- **FR-022**: Existing quick-start.ps1 commands MUST continue to work without flags
- **FR-023**: Default behavior (without flags) MUST match current behavior for existing users
- **FR-024**: New flags MUST be optional with sensible defaults
- **FR-025**: Help output MUST document all available flags and actions

#### Error Handling
- **FR-026**: System MUST validate flag combinations and warn about conflicts
- **FR-027**: System MUST provide clear error messages when dependencies are missing
- **FR-028**: System MUST check for required files (clean logging scripts) before attempting to use them
- **FR-029**: System MUST exit with appropriate error codes (0 = success, 1 = failure)

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### Usability
- **NFR-001**: Default output should be scannable in under 5 seconds for common operations
- **NFR-002**: Detailed output should provide complete diagnostic information for troubleshooting
- **NFR-003**: Flag names should be intuitive and follow PowerShell conventions
- **NFR-004**: Help text should provide usage examples for common scenarios

#### Performance
- **NFR-005**: Verbosity control should not add more than 100ms overhead to command execution
- **NFR-006**: Output suppression should use efficient streaming (not buffering entire output)

#### Maintainability
- **NFR-007**: Implementation should minimize code duplication across actions
- **NFR-008**: Verbosity logic should be centralized in helper functions
- **NFR-009**: Test filtering should use pytest's built-in capabilities (not custom filtering)
